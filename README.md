TimeSeries Using LLMs
Overview
This research project evaluates the possibilities and effectiveness of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Time Series Forecasting. The project explores novel approaches to leverage the pattern recognition and sequential reasoning capabilities of LLMs for predicting future values in time series data.
Motivation
Traditional time series forecasting methods often require specialized model designs for different tasks and applications. In contrast, LLMs have demonstrated robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. This project investigates how to effectively align time series data with natural language to leverage these capabilities for forecasting tasks.
Features

Implementation of time series tokenization techniques for LLMs
Prompt engineering strategies tailored for time series data
Methods for aligning time series embeddings with language space
Evaluation framework for comparing LLM-based approaches with traditional forecasting methods
Adaptations of popular LLM architectures for time series tasks

Key Methods
Our research explores several innovative approaches:

Direct Querying: Using LLMs to generate forecasts through carefully crafted prompts
Custom Tokenization: Techniques for converting numerical time series into formats suitable for LLMs
Cross-Modal Alignment: Methods to bridge the gap between time series data and natural language
Fine-Tuning: Specialized training approaches for adapting LLMs to time series tasks
Model Integration: Hybrid architectures combining LLMs with traditional time series models

Dataset Support
The codebase provides support for processing and evaluating performance on standard time series benchmarks, including:

Economic and financial datasets
Weather and environmental data
Energy consumption data
Sensor readings from IoT devices

Installation
bashgit clone https://github.com/rayapudisaiakhil/TimeSeries-using-LLM-s.git
cd TimeSeries-using-LLM-s
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Detailed usage instructions are provided in the documentation. Basic examples include:
python# Example code for loading a dataset and running a prediction
from models import TimeLLM
from data_utils import load_dataset

# Load your time series data
data = load_dataset("your_dataset.csv")

# Initialize the model
model = TimeLLM(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Get predictions
predictions = model.predict(data, forecast_horizon=7)
Results
Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-based approaches can:

Capture complex temporal dependencies in diverse datasets
Leverage contextual information to improve forecast accuracy
Generalize well across different domains with minimal adaptation
Provide interpretable forecasts with textual explanations

Future Work

Integration with multimodal data sources
Exploring specialized architectures for time-series specific LLMs
Investigating zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities for new datasets
Reducing computational requirements for real-time forecasting applications
